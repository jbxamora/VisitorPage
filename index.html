                <ul>Electricity travels at the speed of light, about 300,000 kilometres per second. A spark of static electricity can measure up to 3,000 volts. The average taser emits 50,000 volts.</ul>
                <ul> A bolt of lightning can measure up to three million (3,000,000) volts (and lasts less than one second).</ul>
                <ul>Fire is the rapid oxidation of a material (the fuel) in the exothermic chemical process of combustion, releasing heat, light, and various reaction products. At a certain point in the combustion reaction, called the ignition point, flames are produced.</ul>
                <ul> The flame is the visible portion of the fire. Flames consist primarily of carbon dioxide, water vapor, oxygen and nitrogen. If hot enough, the gases may become ionized to produce plasma. Depending on the substances alight, and any impurities outside, the color of the flame and the fire's intensity will be different.</ul>

                <ul>Water is an inorganic, transparent, tasteless, odorless, and nearly colorless chemical substance, which is the main constituent of Earth's hydrosphere and the fluids of all known living organisms. It is vital for all known forms of life, despite providing neither food, energy, nor organic micronutrients. </ul>
